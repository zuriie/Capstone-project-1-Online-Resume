<h1>The Best Movies According to Lenora</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Medical Series</h3>
<p>If it in anyway revolves around the hospital, then i'm game.</p>

<h3>Crime Series</h3>
<p>Especially if it is Legal, Cop or Crime investigation centered.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>Everything Fast & Furious and Transporter: Or better still, if the likes of Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson, Van Damme etc are in it, then it is surely going to be interesting.</p>
